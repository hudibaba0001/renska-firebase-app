# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security and configuration issues in the web application, including Content Security Policy violations for external images and Firebase permission errors that are preventing proper functionality of the admin dashboard and payment settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to properly load external images without CSP violations, so that the user interface displays correctly and users have a good visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads external images from Unsplash or other approved domains THEN the system SHALL allow these images to load without CSP violations
2. WHEN a user navigates to any page with external images THEN the browser console SHALL NOT show CSP-related image loading errors
3. IF an image source is not in the approved domains THEN the system SHALL either block it gracefully or provide a fallback image

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access payment configuration settings without permission errors, so that I can manage the payment system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the payment settings page THEN the system SHALL load the payment configuration without Firebase permission errors
2. WHEN fetching payment configuration data THEN the system SHALL have appropriate read permissions in Firestore
3. IF permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful error message to the user instead of console errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Firebase security rules configured, so that the application functions correctly while maintaining appropriate security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes Firestore queries THEN the security rules SHALL allow legitimate operations while blocking unauthorized access
2. WHEN an admin user is authenticated THEN they SHALL have appropriate permissions to read payment configuration data
3. WHEN security rules are updated THEN they SHALL maintain the principle of least privilege while enabling required functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Content Security Policy properly configured, so that the application can load necessary external resources while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CSP is configured THEN it SHALL allow images from approved external domains like Unsplash
2. WHEN the CSP is applied THEN it SHALL maintain security by blocking unauthorized external resources
3. WHEN new external image sources are needed THEN the CSP SHALL be easily updatable to include them
