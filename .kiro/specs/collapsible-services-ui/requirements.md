# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the collapsible services interface in the admin dashboard settings to better handle complex service configurations with addons and prevent the page from becoming excessively long when managing multiple services with detailed configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage multiple services with complex configurations without the page becoming overwhelmingly long, so that I can efficiently navigate and edit my services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have multiple services with addons and detailed configurations THEN the page SHALL remain manageable in length through improved collapsible sections
2. WHEN I expand a service THEN only the essential information SHALL be visible by default with additional sections collapsible
3. WHEN I collapse a service THEN all its configuration details SHALL be hidden to reduce page length

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see a clear overview of my services when they are collapsed, so that I can quickly identify and select the service I want to edit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are collapsed THEN I SHALL see key information like service name, pricing model, and status in the collapsed view
2. WHEN a service has addons configured THEN the collapsed view SHALL indicate the number of addons
3. WHEN a service is active or inactive THEN the collapsed view SHALL clearly show its status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want nested collapsible sections within expanded services, so that I can focus on specific aspects of service configuration without being overwhelmed by all details at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I expand a service THEN advanced configurations like addons SHALL be in separate collapsible subsections
2. WHEN I expand a subsection THEN other subsections SHALL remain collapsed to maintain focus
3. WHEN I need to configure addons THEN they SHALL be in their own collapsible section with clear organization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want visual indicators and smooth animations for collapsible sections, so that the interface feels responsive and I can understand the current state of each section.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click to expand or collapse a section THEN there SHALL be a smooth animation transition
2. WHEN a section is expandable THEN there SHALL be clear visual indicators (arrows, icons) showing its state
3. WHEN I interact with collapsible sections THEN the interface SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the ability to expand multiple services simultaneously when needed, so that I can compare configurations or work on multiple services at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to compare services THEN I SHALL have the option to expand multiple services at once
2. WHEN multiple services are expanded THEN each SHALL maintain its own collapsible subsections independently
3. WHEN the page becomes too long with multiple expanded services THEN I SHALL have an option to collapse all services at once
